## Problem Description
[LeetCode 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Remove duplicates from the array, keeping at most two occurrences of each element.

## Solution
### Approach: Two Pointer
I used two pointers to adjust the indices and solve the problem following the logic below:
```
Approach: Two Pointer
#111223
 ij      <- If equal, it's the first duplicate
  ij     <- If equal, increment the duplicate count
  ij    <- If duplicate count is 2 or more, only increment j
  i j   <- If different element is found
    ij   <- Increment i
#112123 <- Swap
    i j  <- If equal and duplicate count is less than 2
    ij
#112213
    ij
    i j  <- If different element is found
      ij  <- Increment i
#112231  <- Swap
      ij  <- If different element is found
      i/j <- Increment i and swap
        j  <- j reached the end
```
Moving the indices i and j according to the above logic ensures that only up to two duplicates are retained, and the rest are removed.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Return 0 if nums is empty
        if not nums:
            return 0
            
        i = 0 
        j = 1
        dup = 1
        while i < len(nums) and j < len(nums):
            # If items are equal
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                # If no consecutive items, increment i and swap with j
                if dup < 2:
                    i = i + 1
                    nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
                # If consecutive items exist, increment j and increase dup
                j = j + 1
                dup += 1
            else:
                i = i + 1
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i] 
                j = j + 1
                dup = 1
        return i + 1
```

The time and space complexity of the above solution are as follows:

* Time Complexity: O(N)
  - There is a loop for nums, resulting in O(N) time complexity.

* Space Complexity: O(1)
  - No additional space is used.
