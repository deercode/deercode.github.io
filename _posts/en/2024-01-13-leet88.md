## Problem Description
[LeetCode 88. Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given two ascending order lists, merge them into a single sorted list. However, there is a condition: the sorting must be done in-place on the nums1 array.

## Solution
### Approach
1) Copy the nums2 array to the beginning of nums1 at positions 0, 0, and so on.
2) Sort the copied array using the sort() function.

```python
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        nums1[m:] = nums2[:] # [1,2,3,2,5,6],

        nums1.sort() # [1,2,3,2,5,6] #Tim sort O(nlogn)
```

The time and space complexity of the above solution are as follows:

* Time Complexity: O((m+n)log(m+n))
  - The sort() function in Python 3 uses Tim sort with a time complexity of O(nlogn). Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m+n).

* Space Complexity: O(1)
  - No additional space is used.
