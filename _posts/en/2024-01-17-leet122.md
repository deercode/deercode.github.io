## Problem Description
[Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks multiple times. Unlike [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150), this problem allows multiple transactions of buying and selling.

## Solution
### Approach
This problem can be easily solved by visualizing the list as a graph. If we represent it as a stock graph, we can catch the turning points and accumulate the profit.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        low = prices[0]     # Set the first price as the lowest price
        before = prices[0]  # Initialize the previous price
        acc = 0             # Initialize the cumulative profit

        # Iterate through prices
        for v in prices:
            # If the current price is greater than or equal to the previous price, continue
            if before <= v:
                before = v
                continue

            # If the current price is less than the previous price, update the cumulative profit and set the lowest and previous prices to the current price
            acc += before - low
            before = low = v

        # Update the cumulative profit for the last remaining part
        acc += before - low
        return acc
```

The time complexity and space complexity of this solution are as follows:

* Time Complexity: O(N)
  - As the loop iterates through prices, the time complexity is O(N).

* Space Complexity: O(1)
  - No additional space is used.
