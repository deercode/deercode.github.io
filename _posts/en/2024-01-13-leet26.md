## Problem Description
[LeetCode 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Algorithm to remove duplicates from a sorted array and return the value of the remaining elements.

## Solution
### Approach: Two Pointer
Used Two Pointer to adjust two indices, left and right, while removing duplicate values.
```
Approach: Two Pointer
#0011122334
 ij         <- If i and j are the same
 i j        <- Only move j up by 1
#0011122334 <- If i and j are different
  ij        <- Move i up by 1
#0101122334 <- Swap the two values
  i j       <- Move j up by 1
#0101122334 <- Swap the two values
  i  j      <- If i and j are the same, move j up by 1
  i   j     <- If i and j are different
   i  j     <- Move i up by 1
#0121102334 <- Swap the two values
...         <- Repeat this process
```
By moving i and j as described above, duplicate values are removed.

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        i = 0 
        j = 1
        cnt = 1
        while i < len(nums) and j < len(nums):
            if nums[i] == nums[j]:
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
                j += 1
                cnt += 1
        return cnt 
```

The time and space complexity of the above solution are as follows:

* Time Complexity: O(N)
  - It takes time proportional to the size of nums.

* Space Complexity: O(1)
  - Only a few simple variables are used, resulting in O(1) space complexity.
