## Problem Description
[LeetCode 169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Find the element that appears more than n/2 times in a list.

## Solution
### Approach: Two Pointer
1) Traverse the entire list and create a dictionary.
2) Return the value in the dictionary that appears more than n/2 times.

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dic = {}
        for i in nums:
            if i not in dic:
                dic[i] = 1
            dic[i] += 1
        
        leng = len(nums)
        for i, v in dic.items():
            if v > leng//2 + 1:
                return i
```

The time and space complexity of the above solution are as follows:

* Time Complexity: O(N)
  - We iterate through the list nums, resulting in O(N) time complexity.

* Space Complexity: O(N)
  - We use a dictionary that grows with the size of nums, resulting in O(N) additional space usage.
